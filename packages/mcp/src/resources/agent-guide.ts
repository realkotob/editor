  '2. Create visible massing first: `create_level` as needed, then `create_story_shell` once per story.',
  '3. Add room semantics next: zones/rooms, interior walls, slabs, and ceilings. Prefer `create_room` for simple rooms and `apply_patch` only for exact multi-room partitions.',
  '4. Add circulation and envelope details: `create_stair_between_levels`, then `add_door` and `add_window`.',
  '5. Add `create_roof`, furniture with `furnish_room`/`place_item`, and exterior features such as fences, patios, driveways, lawns, and garden zones.',

  '## Construction rules',
  '',
  '- Levels live under a Building.',
  '- Walls, fences, zones, slabs, ceilings, roofs, and stairs live under a Level.',
  '- Doors and windows live under their Wall. Use `add_door`/`add_window`; their `t` or `position` is 0..1 along the wall.',
  '- Floor items live under a Level; wall/ceiling-attached items live under their target Wall or Ceiling.',
  '- For multi-story buildings, create separate level-owned exterior walls for each story. Do not make first-story walls taller to represent upper-story bearing walls.',
  '- Use `create_story_shell` once per floor/story to avoid cross-level wall ownership mistakes.',
  '- Use `create_stair_between_levels` for stairs. It creates a straight stair and one rectangular manual slab/ceiling opening while disabling automatic stair-opening mode, avoiding duplicate or irregular holes.',
  '- Roofs are containers with roof segments and should be isolated on a dedicated roof level for solo/exploded level views. Use `create_roof`; by default it creates a roof level above the reference occupied level. Do not attach roofs directly to the top occupied floor unless explicitly requested.',
  '- Story count means occupied stories, not raw level count. A two-story house may correctly have three levels when the third level has metadata role `roof`; do not delete roof/support levels to satisfy a requested story count.',
  '- Use `pascal://constraints/{levelId}` when you need existing slab holes or wall footprints for precise placement.',
  '',
  '## Scene model facts exposed here so agents do not need repo inspection',
  '',
  '- X/Z are floor-plan axes and Y is vertical; dimensions are meters.',
  '- A story wall height is normally 2.4-3.0m; wall thickness is normally 0.1-0.3m.',
  '- Slab and ceiling holes are polygon arrays. Manual stair openings should have `holeMetadata` with source `manual` and a single rectangular polygon.',
  '- Dedicated roof levels use metadata role `roof` and normally contain the roof only; the top occupied level keeps its own walls, rooms, slabs, and ceiling.',
  '- `verify_scene` reports `occupiedStoryCount`, `supportLevelCount`, and `roofLevelIds`; use those fields instead of `levelCount` when checking story-count requirements.',
  '- Saved site children can contain embedded building objects for compatibility, but tools handle parent/child bookkeeping. Prefer tools over raw graph surgery for common construction.',
  '- `validate_scene` checks schema correctness. `verify_scene` checks practical layout issues such as empty levels, missing rooms/floors/doors, bad openings, stair obstructions, and suspicious multi-story wall heights.',
  '',
  '## Tool preference',
  '',
  '- Prefer semantic tools first: `create_story_shell`, `create_room`, `add_door`, `add_window`, `create_stair_between_levels`, `create_roof`, `furnish_room`, `place_item`.',
  '- Use `apply_patch` for bulk exact edits after semantic tools have established the main structure.',
